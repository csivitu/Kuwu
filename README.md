**Kuwu** is a discord utility bot implemented to be used specifically with CTF(s). It can help you organize and manage the CTF with it's varied features such as monitoring the challenges as well as first blood updates. The bot also filters out flags from the csictf discord server. It was also used in one of the challenges where teams had to DM the bot for the flag.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The bot is made with the help of discord.py library which is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord. The bot uses web sockets to connect to the challenges to perform regular health checks. The health checks were conducted every 120 seconds. Here is an example:

  </a>
</p>

The bot also gave first blood updates and for that, selenium python library was used as ctfd requires login to access the first blood data. Here is an example of first blood updates:
<p>

  </a>

The bot checked all messages sent to the server for filtering flags.
